# Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the **selling price of cars** based on various features such as manufacturing year, fuel type, kilometers driven, transmission type, and more. It's an ideal beginner-friendly project to understand regression in machine learning.


## Problem Statement

The price of a car depends on several factors like:
- Brand goodwill
- Manufacturing year
- Fuel type
- Kilometers driven
- Transmission type
- Ownership history

In this project, we train a machine learning model to **predict the price of a used car** based on these factors.


##  Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

- `Car_Name`: Name of the car
- `Year`: Year of manufacture
- `Selling_Price`: Price the owner wants to sell
- `Present_Price`: Ex-showroom price when new
- `Kms_Driven`: Kilometers driven
- `Fuel_Type`: Petrol/Diesel/CNG
- `Seller_Type`: Dealer or Individual
- `Transmission`: Manual or Automatic
- `Owner`: Number of previous owners
